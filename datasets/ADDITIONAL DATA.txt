fucking moron, the point here is that a right facing swastika represents nazi ideals, a LEFT facing swastika represent buddism ideals YOU didn't spot that The SCHOOL didn't spot that I SPOTTED IT

What's the problem in Palmer? that people like spreading the idea of buddism? So should we ban crosses in school?

Oh, you mean the people who drew it THOUGHT they were drawing a symoble of nazi ideals but instead drew something representing budist ideals? well wouldn't that qualify them for fucking RETARDS AS I ORIGINALLY WROTE?

Yes, you're completely fucking wrong asshole As I've said time and time again, it's the fucking German spelling It doesn't matter how many times English authors have mistakenly used this spelling, it's still a fucking mistake! The only correct spelling is the Dutch one As the Dutch discovered it, not the Germans Let's start using the German spelling of everything else in English, why don't we? That's your logic A bunch of dumbasses use the wrong spelling over and over again, so your logic is to think, oh, its just a varient! I'm a fucking idiot with no fucking common sense Exactly All of you need to shut the fuck up and stop talking out of your asses

investigate their legal options and force wikipieida to removed their biography from this website	1

This is a message to Beam,

What the fuck do you think this is, some place where you can just waltz in unannounced and be received with arms wide open? WELL FUCK THAT! This is motherfucking Wikipedia, bitch WE call the shots WE ALWAYS get shotgun WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you WE are always first in line WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT 

No one here will ever like you WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME WE pioneered class WE made 'cool' cool And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't You just do NOT 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH Do you get it now?

I intend to revert this edit, in hopes of attracting the attention of an admin that is willing to look at the issue itself, and not throw accusations around quite so liberally Perhaps, if you achieve a level of civility where you can do this, we can have a rational discussion on the topic and resolve the matter peacefully	0

And how could he be 22 when his birthday passed?

Re-considering 1st paragraph edit?
I don't understand the reasons for 's recent edit of this article  not that I'm sure that the data are necessarily wrong  Rather, I'm persuaded that the strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is an unhelpful approach to this specific subject  I note that articles about other sitting Justices have been similarly enhanced; and I also believe those changes are no improvement  

In support of my view that this edit should be reverted, I would invite anyone to re-visit articles written about the following pairs of jurists
 A1 Benjamin Cardozo
 A2 Learned Hand

 B1 John Marshall Harlan
 B2 John Marshall Harlan II

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale

At a minimum, I'm questioning this edit?  It deserves to be reconsidered   	0

ENGLISH	I was able to post the above list so quickly because I already had it in a text file in my hard drive  I've been meaning to get around to updating the sound list for some time now 
As far as generating interest  I've spent four years trying to drum up more interest in freely licensed full length classical music Unfortunately, my attempts failed - I'm still effectively the only one who does it The classical music wikiproject was not interested, (Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Classical_music/Archive_5#Need_help21Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_3#I_could_use_some_helpWikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music/Archive_2#Raulbot2C_and_the_music_list) So I really had given up trying to interest others

Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with

 Mainland Asia includes the lower basin of China's Yangtze River as well as Korea  But being specific is fine too  I just found a citation for a more comprehensive DNA study by Hammer below, rather than our generarizations and speculation so far 

 Citation for Yayoi culture was brought to Japan by migrants from Korea, who in turn trace their roots to southeast Asia/south China 

 2005 DNA study by Hammer
 Describes the Yayoi migration from Korea based on the O-SRY(465) genes and other genes with close lineage (haplogroups O-M122 and O-M95)
Reiterates that the entire O haplogroup has been proposed to have a Southeast Asian origin  (Their definition of Southeast Asia includes southern China)  Then hypothesizes that the dispersals of Neolithic farmers from Southeast Asia also brought haplogroup O lineages to Korea and eventually to Japan
 In the concluding paragraph, it states we propose that the Yayoi Y chromosomes descend from prehistoric farmers that had their origins in southeastern Asia, perhaps going back to the origin of agriculture in this region
 Hammer's DNA study is based on a global sample consisted of > 2,500 males from 39 Asian populations, including six populations sampled from across the Japanese archipelago

As far as I'm aware (owning numerous books on the subject) that is not the scholary consensus at all The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a Third Way as the references show

The only dissenters I'm aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible This of course does not come from educated people in a position to write books For example, even the foremost scholary expert on Fascism, and a former member of both the Communist Party and then Socialist Party of Italy, Renzo De Felice doesn't try to cover up its socialistic origins and third way status This is a man who has wrote a definitive seven volume piece on Mussolini -

BI, you said you wanted to talk

At the bottom of the lead section you have written:

Its promoter speculated in 1994 that the skyhook concept could be cost competitive with what is realistically thought to be achievable using a space elevator, but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials

Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials

That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10  The full quote is

If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload,
then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly
feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in
the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher
operational temperatures

It then goes on to say

As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL
tethers needed The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is:
“We don't need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make
the space tether facility for a HASTOL system Existing materials will do”

So it would appear that you misread your reference  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with presently available commercial materials

To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states

The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is
technically feasible We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will
allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space
tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into
Earth orbit For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design
solution using existing, or near-term technologies We expect that a number of the other
HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to
detailed design studies The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically
reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access

Regarding: but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts and 

A 2000 Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts

The full quote is:

In 1995 Zubrin proposed the “Hypersonic Skyhook” as a solution to the mismatch between
the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers

Hi Could you please stop enforcing the category Christian arabs on non arabic Christians living in the middle east? This is wrong We middle-eastern Christians, though not arabs, have gone through Arabization, and that needs to stop We are not arabs We have our own ethnicity, and we shouldn't be forced to be called Christian arabs If a Christian European is born in the middle east, should he be called a Christian arab because of that reason alone? Please understand, they are Syriac Christians (ie of Assyrian ancestry), and most of them speak Aramaic, though a lot of them are forgetting it As someone who speaks Aramaic, you should respect this fact, and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they're in the middle east We are not closely related to the arabs from Saudiarabia We have our own ethnicity, please stop forcing upon us some alien arab ethnicity That's oppression |Talk 12:17 26 Jun, 2007 (UTC)	0

Is it scientific to attribute an event A, to cause B, where cause B was deliberate designed, with some sort of intelligent intent? Don't answer the questions beyond that
Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged There are several major fundamental problems here  

First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes No evidence of paul and his ox remain i mean, really  

Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with probabilities If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it This is such a perversion of science You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand ID is just making up their numbers  

Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, B is unknown Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if A were a dead body and B were a bullet in the heart You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him You don't have that with life on earth You have ONE scenario, A, and you have no other cases to observe or test So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed B (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed) So, in that sense, no, it isn't science  	0

ENGLISH	Paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned

The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with	0

= My Famous Article ==witze  happiness − wikipedia The Witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families, regardless of race, age, character or knowledge The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman

The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek' He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come

                           History
The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence' Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons

                       Proper History
As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history However good times were to come for the Witzeman Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the historythe Great Rebellion of 1988 This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked This was thought to be an act of circambulation However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life' This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted	0

Yep LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned) ) 
By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons) This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo ;)   15	0

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one) For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK) The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term  The same tag team practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me Again, if you would like evidence just ask

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under UK mediation section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you If you're going to be an admin, may I suggest you please make yourself familiar with the policies and guidelines I have referenced in this message Rather than accusing me, a user who is being cyberstalked, of personal attacks Systematic bias is not acceptable, you're here to make sure that our policies are upheld not to chip in for the sake of a friend Thanks -   	0

 Socialistm? 

There are two important features of Smith's concept of the invisible hand First, Smith was not advocating a social policy (that people should act in their own self interest), but rather was describing an observed economic reality (that people do act in their own interest) Second, Smith was not claiming that all self-interest has beneficial effects on the community He did not argue that self-interest is always good; he merely argued against the view that self-interest is necessarily bad It is worth noting that, upon his death, Smith left much of his personal wealth to charity

ENGLISH	== Attributing and classifying of personalities == 
Invitation Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed 
Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains 

My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania 
We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us Cultural aspirations of the later Nat Ren may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N Ren could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture Čiurlionis is the best example here 
In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below) 
We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen So, many researchers don't pay attention to this difference Especially in the Soviet period, when national ideas were officially forbidden, mixture in description of these movements was allowed E g philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas, who clearly depends to the first generation, is often described as liberal And it may be understood in a sense of the second generation (as idea of liberalism)
 

 period and generation  artists, writers, philosophers etc in a context of Lithuania in an European context The National Renaissance period, the younger generation, approx 1905 – 1930  painter and composer  Čiurlionis, painter Kazys Šimonis, poet and philosopher Vilius Storastas - Vydūnas, dramatist Sofija Kymantaitė - Čiurlionienė, poets Adomas Jakštas, Motiejus Gustaitis, Liudas Gira, composer Stasys Šimkus, philosopher Ramūnas Bytautas  reformers and innovators of Lithuanian culture Representatives of Lithuanian culture, almost unknown before them The period between WWI and WWII and post-war years   poets V Mykolaitis - Putinas, Kazys Binkis, writer Ignas Šeinius – Jurkūnas, artists: all 'ars' group,  philosopher Juozas Girnius  Modernists, introducing new Western ideas into Lithuanian cultural life  Central European modernism

ENGLISH	Homosexuals are intent on legitimizing their behavior Therefore, they will seize any opportunity to suggest that famous persons are gay In this way, their way of life will be received as being not only harmless, but perfectly normal As generations of people grow from childhood to maturity and are exposed to this strategy, they increasingly develop a tolerance for homosexuality In this way, it is now almost universally accepted as a diverse or alternate behavior or way of being, similar to a religion, race,  or nationality Lestrade	0

 Link to Sacramento 

I placed a wikipedia-link in this article where the word Sacramento appears  Another editor, who appears to be stalking me and is reverting everything that I do, claims that I am overlinking by doing this  I have read the policy, and think I understand it, and I disagree with him  The word Sacramento was not linked anywhere else in this article before I made the link, and I think that my link provided good context for a reader who did not know Walnut Creek but thought that maybe they knew Sacramento  Was there anything wrong with my link?

A TotallyDisputed notice would probably be appropriate, given the depth of disagreement that exists here, but I cannot understand why highlighting statements identified by some as dubious would constitute disfiguring the article  SlimVirgin has also used that wording recently, but I rather think that inaccurate and irrelevant information is more of a disfigurement than is a template notice

 Randroide Answers to Next Step 

Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation

I can not do this job because I always connect from filtered institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial truncation of words by the software I do not want that happenning

Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided? Thank you 

 Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 

  At last we agree on something!of course that the new section is a good idea: The false suicidal terrorists from PRISA will also be included there 

Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me 

But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources Just like me citing El País in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb Cheers  

 

Indeed, a good point And all the remarks in COPE too And the moral certitudes of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo

  I agree with you 100%, Larean

  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not 

  You are right, Southofwatford, in your Randroide omits section

If you have not subscription to El País, I am sorry but that´s your problem My institutional access also has some advantages, like paid access to El País (and many, many other publications and books) That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of filtered Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources

Do you see? The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources

BTW, if you write under a Randroide answers section you are:
Invading my space I do not mind, really But you are doing it
Risking new truncations on your messages To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE Randroide answers sections

If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV The article is not mine

  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable

  

All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article

Very funny, Southofwatford 

I am going to follow this joke of yours

Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book
Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home
Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish

It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really I had a good laugh

User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response

 An important message 

Block me I can live with it

The mess that's being made of Parker v District of Columbia is why Wikipedia can't rise above the level of a sophisticated Blog

The Controversy section doesn't belong there in the first place, and the fact that you and other non-experts are issuing warnings indicates Wikipedia has become a sandbox for idiots

Sorry I can't be more polite, but that's the long and short of it

The organization of sub-topics Culture is thrown way down towards the end, after economy and tourism, which is inappropriate The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive Information is interspersed all through the sub-sections, without regard to whether or not they fit there Eg, the Geography section starts with the fact that UP is the 5th largest state That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination In any case, Cities of Uttar Pradesh can be an interesting topic on its own, because, UP has several interesting cities (and regions) each with specialities of its own (like the copperware of Moradabad, ceramics of Khurja and carpets of Bhadohi) In fact I remember there used to be such information in the article before(  )	0
ENGLISH	I don't know the answer to this, but

Legally, how is it possible for a private citizen to violate another private citizen's civil rights?
I don't know if this is the section Nelson was charged under in the federal case, but if anyone could explain this, I would appreciate it

You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time  Look at Issei Sagawa  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right  I don't think it's going out on a limb to say that the Sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief	0

I correctly added the race and sexuality of Chirlane McCray ONCE but someone (the same person who removed the factual information I provided under Charter Schools) was incredibly rude and stated it was vandalism and reported it  How can this be and why are these descriptions considered negative?? Who decides what is reverted? On Chirlane McCray's own Wikipedia site the word black (I prefer African American) is mentioned SIX times and her sexuality is mentioned over and over again These are not assertions at all and can be referenced by an approved Wikipedia site and Chirlane McCray's own important writings  What is the problem?	0

ENGLISH	==Deletion of Account==

Ok Blueboy, Editing from L31 G0NG L41 has been disabled by Blueboy96 for the following reason(s):

Came back from 31-hour block and picked it right back up again  and judging by history, not likely to get it

for this:

this is to call attention to a topic which was resolved before any of the matters were addressed

there are moderators deleting Wikipedia History items, and moderator BorgQueen's edit of Cuisine of Hawaii was simply a provocation and nothing more

I am a reknowned Chef of Pacific Rim Cuisine, and the Cuisine of Hawaii, and the Cuisine of Hawaii is NOT local plate lunch that is like saying the cuisine of Mexico is Frozen Burritos, or that the Cuisine of Canada is Starbucks pastries, or that the Cuisine of America is McDonald's Its Slanderous, Vicious, and Spiteful

the main point here is WHY did the admin in question DELETE THE HISTORY???

and no, it is NOT Resolved until that problem is addressed

and I TRIED discussing it with that user directly and my account was LOCKED

THAT USER IS NOT OPEN FOR DISCUSSION OR DDEBATE, THAT ADMIN SUFFERS THE GOD-COMPLEX, AND LOVCKED ME FROM EVEN EDITING MY OWN PAGE, HENCE THE REASON I HAD TO WAIT TO BE UNBANNED TO POST HERE, AND I AM NOT LEVING HERE TO BACK AND BECOME CORRUPT-ADMIN FODDER BACK AON THE TOPIC PAGE UNTIL THIUS MATTER IS RESOLVED BETWEEN BORGQUEEN AND MYSELF AS i I WILL NOT SUBJEGATE MYSELF TO ANY FURTHER DISCRIMINATION, HAZING, OR PERSONAL VENDETTAS

Not likely to get it eh buddy?

listen up, You will delete my User page and account from the wiki, grommet, you are not going to lock  me and keep my name, content or profile

I am out of this facade which is Wikipedia for good

delete it all, NOW grommet

Can't have watched very carefully can you? William being Mulder's son is frequently referenced to in the final episode Just off the top of my head:

Guard: What are you thinking about?
Mulder: My son His mother

Scully: Our son, Mulder I gave him up Our son I was so afraid you could never forgive me

Not to mention the meaningful looks that Mulder and Scully give each other when the officiator at the hearing asks, Agent Scully, isn't it true that you and Mulder were lovers, and you got pregnant and had his love child?	0

661858580's rant

Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as primitive and rural (even fashist) being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, performed on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition
 
Another apostle of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as gusle players 

Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian) However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović's book Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje, 1568) Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547) Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p 42) Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry 
 
Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond To honour Kačić's work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument  

In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music According to dr fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915)  As for Dalmatian women, they didn't play gusle (it's    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound 

Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar 

The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition English writer Maude M Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West that the gusle was the national instrument of the region As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p54)

This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p 9)

Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region 

Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock 'n' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre	0

The vote was on the Campbell Case but the primary reason was the Russian Treaties:

Baldwin was careful to emphasise that the Treaties were the substance of his objections Standfordham wrote to the King, on 7 October, 'I saw Mr Baldwin who, in reply to my question Do you want to turn the Government out? said Yes, but not on the Campbell issue, but on the Russian Treaties which the country generally condemns He sees no alternative to a dissolution; it has always been expected, some wished for it before now, though he is opposed to hastening the Government's fall '  And it is true that only in the House of Commons were Baldwin's strictures based on the Campbell case – at Newcastle on 2 October he congratulated MacDonald on the agreement, achieved at a conference in London, on the Dawes Plan for reparations, and then spent the rest of the speech alternately pouring scorn on the Labour party's subservience to its extremists, and tearing to pieces the Russian agreement But the final debate on 8 October was a mean Parliamentary occasion Two days before, in a meeting which was something of a suave qui puet, the Cabinet decided to take it as a vote of confidence, preferring to go out on the Campbell case to a defeat on the Russian Treaties which might give the left wing too much prominence—Middlemas and Barnes, p 273  	0

Now that Apple Inc has admitted that they did in fact use child labour, this is clearly a far, far more serious type of criticism than everything currently mentioned in this main article's criticism summary section The explicit word child labor should be mentioned in this article 7834240197  	0

  Thanks From my point of view there are differences and parallels between the two concepts: One parallel is that both concepts are intending a territory with a homogeneous population The difference is: the concept of racial hygiene is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium race (whatever race might be), the concept of ethnically homogeneous states is intending a homogeneous population regarding the criterium ethnicity A second difference is that the concept of racial hygiene has led to more extreme forms and methods in political practice in history (example: the holocaust - not only expulsion but also extinction of millions of people in an industrially organised process) (User, Nov 17th, 2006)	0

Quoting Hoppe first; Detailing Kinsella's important points
At this diff I put in the Democracy section Hoppe's earlier comment first and followed with more about what Kinsella said, ie,:
Stephan Kinsella writes that Hoppe's critics have accused Hoppe of homophobia, bigotry, and the like based on these passages Kinsella wrote that that Hoppe's discussion of physically removing homosexuals and other groups only applied to private, covenant-based communities centered around traditional values He shared a letter Hope wrote to him saying the gay couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled, but only those who are openly hostile to the basic heterosexual or private property basis of society

Unfortunately, judging from previous warnings, some people here have a rather unusual view of what personal attacks are Pointing out that the individuals accusing me of using sockpuppets were incorrect  and in fact the two main people making the accusations have been harassing me for months and had used sockpuppets and meat puppets themselves for getting around edit conflicts and to stack votes on a Request for Admin proceding, as pointed out by several editors at the time  certainly cannot be considered a personal attack Pointing out that admins did not have any actual policy basis to make the blocks is not a personal attack (and it has, in fact, been confirmed by the overruling of the blocks more than once) 

Frankly, if you are looking for personal attacks, try yourself for your AGF-violating attacks on my actions based upon limited information and actually misleading information given to you by other individuals, or David Gerard for claiming that I am trolling when all i am doing is defending myself from false accusations of others It's very clear that a number of people here need to realize that the very things they are accusing me of and trying to justify for a block are exactly what they themselves are doing from behind the pretense of trying to solve things

If you want to start blocking for incivility, I might suggest removing David Gerard for a while for his actions, or Elonka for falsely claiming that I was using sockpuppets or that I was harassing her, or the sysop whose very talk page says he's going to go around blocking people no questions asked and in fact did so after I caught him restoring placing illegal information on how to pirate software an article talk page Rules should apply to everyone, and a number of people have been getting away with pretty flagrant violations and trying to rationalize them away by just labeling me as an alleged problem editor and not taking any sort of responsibility for their own actions  	0

Has anyone considered how matter (the stuff we are all made from) actually interact with time and time travel? If I were to travel back in time, would I be 'frozen' and isolated in spacetime, whilst everything else around me travel backwards in time, or will I also physically and biologically travel back in time, that is I get younger and younger, and then disappear because I was not yet created, thus defeating the Grandfather Paradox? Although if it were possible for signals (or information) to travel backwards and forwards in time, does this possibility automatically extend to matter as we know it (ie particles giving rise to electrons, protons and neutrons, and ultimately biological beings such as ourselves)?  02:30, 30 July	0

 Can there be a more concise listing? 

The listing of other inventions is profoundly vague Why group 4 different categories together? Why even mention things that the chinese received purely from outside sources? There should be a much more complete, well managed list of chinese developments, which I've yet to find- along with how these were transmitted globally, and whether or not places like Europe got them purely from the Chinese

This really needs the attention of people with some remote expertise, which I guess is somewhat there when Needham's work, which is profoundly rare in private collections was cited- not like the arrogant bigoted ass who was crying about chinese nationalism, yet then went onto say that they only invented noodles

And besides, why are things like the cannon and porcelain listed under other inventions? Who developed these independently?	0
ENGLISH	In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism They are free to do this, but this cuts against their claims of being mainstream historians	0

Darwinism was not accepted over-night There appears to be more sense in  the  AAT origins, than the sort-cut hypothesis that our  ancestors went from swinging in trees to the prairies (and then, eons later, take up a sedentary life style so they could edit Wikipedia and face book etc, all day) One only has to watch little kids on the beach  The first time a wave throws them bottom-over-elbow they may well cry – but after a time,  they can't wait to get into the water again It is as if  being at home on a sea-edge environment is hard-wired into their genes  Unfortunately, the rise in sea level since these times means that evidence of these coastal communities may never be found  Keep plugging away until the old hypothesis fade away	0

Hi,

Can you explain on its talk page why you protected this article?

There is some edit warring going on, but not very heavy (for the standards of this article) Also I am a participant in a mediation case, but that concerns actually only the use of one source on this page, and is irrelevant to the present edit warring

Apparently, other editors agree that the edits I made were justified  A group of meat-puppets working as a team to revert an article to their own POV is what has caused this block  At issue was the advert tag which is justified, was placed on the article by one editor, replaced by me, replaced again by another editor, and replaced again by me  Three editors, so far, have indicated the tag belongs there  I'm sure a forth editor is going to weigh in on this side too  The article is riddled with brochure language  Please note that I was removing brochure language right up to the lock-up of the article  There's still lots more in there that needs to come out before the advert tag should be removed  Additionally, I don't believe I broke the 3RR rule which requires a fourth reversion

ENGLISH	While I agree that Indus valley civilisation is the correct name for the civilisation, the passage quoted above is not neccecarily factual in terms of saying Second there is no proof at all that the mighty Sarasvati of the Rigveda was in fact this (now dry) river- the identification is itself open to doubt Apart from there being facts/proof to indicate that Saraswati did exist as this dry river ( including geological facts as to why it dried up) The evidence also points to the fact that it was NOT a tributary of the Indus, ( refuting point 3 of the passage quoted above ) and in fact drew the waters of the Sutlej and the Yamuna to be a river system of it's own And though a large number of sites have been found along this river system, none of them are of the scale of Harrapa / Mohenjodaro, leaving the Indus Valley tag as the correct one Saraswati did exist,today the timing is disputed and not the existence, Wheter it is vedic and indic vs Harrapan and non vedic is more disputed today than it's existence	0

All of those statements need to be referenced  Leaving an article unreferenced in every section opens the door for original research and the introduction for factually inaccurate information  To point out one thing, I'll bring up Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012  First, it has a number of tags on it, the creation of articles that need to be tagged should be reason number 1 to remove the flag  Second, the only reference/link provided on the article is this one while the information is from various subpages of that  It appears that the entirety of the article is found at this deeper link  It's possible that some came from this as well, I can't tell  I'll also note that the style of the summary it was taken from was never meant to be encyclopedic, so the article is riddled with grammatical errors, mostly incomplete sentences  On creation, the opening read Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012 (HR 2055) is a bill passed to the 112th United States Congress  I've never heard this usage (to rather than by) and assume it is incorrect, another editor changed it, the lead is also missing an important determiner  In any case, you can take a look at  Vesey 	0

ENGLISH	Hi Fracophonie,

Thanks for taking the time to write such a long message - I appreciate this

In terms of what I said about the age - I didn't mean to cause offense I thought I read somewhere that you had to be over 18 to make these decisions but I think I was getting confused with the check user privileges 

I have already read some of those policies but will read the rest later today I am not a troll - I just need time to get used to all these acronyms, policies etc

From what started out with me writing an article about my favourite website has turned into a massive thing which was not what I was expecting

I really don't have any more time to argue and debate with the usrs since its clear they just want it deleted despite what I have said For example one user just wrote there is another site called Amiritenet This is Amiritecom!! This is precisely why I had to keep responding on the AFC delete page 

In terms of the rest I agree to do them (of course I can only apologise once I am unblocked) - can you apologise for me?

On a side note I am actually French and Jewish (shame about the gay part though:)	0

ENGLISH	:::::::::: Tim, firstly I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this issue offline, and for your willingness to debate it at length here despite the majority view here being in your favour Yes I certainly agree with your friend that it is very important to describe the jurisidictions that a firm is present in, there is clearly a massive diffence between, say having offices in the French or Japanese jurisdictions, or between the Chinese and US jurisdictions, since the legal and regulatory systems are very different, as well as the commercial characteristics of the markets

 Beyond that however it remains my firm view that there is a big difference between a law firm having an office in, say, Paris or Toulouse, even though they are both in the same jurisdiction I appreciate that the situation in the US is slightly more complex since you have both federal and state jurisdictions Even within each state there will be big differences between the legal markets in different cities though To give an example, the San Jose market will be not just a lot smaller overall than the Los Angeles market, but it will also have a quite different profile - on the whole a lot more specialist, niche and focused on high tech 

 To give another example, in the UK a law firm could never be regarded as being truly top tier if it didn't have an office in London, even if it had offices in every other big city In fact all of the very top tier UK firms (DLA Piper is not yet regarded as one of them, despite its size) have just one UK office, in London, although they have other offices overseas 

 Saying that DLA has  has 69 offices across the United States, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya, Thailand, China,  would in my view still mean a loss of valuable information to the reader We could fall back on using descriptions like in major financial centres or in major commercial centres or in a combination of major financial centres and major commercial centres but then we are introducing what is in my view an unnecesssary element of vagueness, imprecision and even original research

 I do accept that DLA, with 69 offices, is right on the borderline of having too many offices to make it practical to list all of them in the article However I do also feel that there is an important general point of principal that information about the office locations of a law firm is very valuable information to aid the reader of an article in understanding the subject of it, and should be included as much as possible

Speedy deletion of Andrew takao
 A tag has been placed on Andrew takao requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines     	0

Nope, I didn't read the guide to appealing, didn't have time The user in question IS engaged in harassment, I've been doing this long enough to know and I can prove it He/she immediately placed a threatening notice of blocking me permanently on my user page, reverted the article while I was in the midst of editing it (my second pass, couldn't even preview changes), then changed his/her mind as to my real wiki-sin, since the onus for proving the Doris Day available as PD on archiveorg was on him/her not me and the usual span for pre-Bern had expired long ago,  decided my REAL sin was Original Research (oh noes), and continued to revert based on that Does OR add clutter? Sure it can, but if the user in question was REALLY concerned about that, about the quality of the article and about extraneous details, WHY DIDN'T HE/SHE EVEN NOTICE two paragraphs already there, comprising about 1/3 of the entire article, dealt with Norman Schwarzkopf, an unrelated book and an unrelated ice cream store name? I'll tell you why: the user wasn't engaged in good-faith/goodwill editing and the normal back-and-forth that leads to better articles He/she was involved in blocking input to the article Why? Was it personal against me, or was it to preserve the existing content of the article, including the false claims and extraneous material not even concerned with ther subject at hand? I can only speculate, but I'd guess it's some sort of power trip and wiki-bullying I don't really have time for this I have made a fair number of very good edits over the years and have usually refrained from saying anything that isn't directly related to content and improving articles I could pretend this user didn't do what he/she did, but I'm wasting my own time here and I don't really have a stake in any such pretense I don't have any stake in improving this article either, no dog in the race, I just see how it can be improved and made more informative As a long-term wikipedia user and editor, I don't see any problem in jumping in and fixing something I almost expect some sort of pushback now, but not over completely minor edits which are very good and on-target in very minor stub-like articles The problem isn't me here, it's that if people such as the user in question can get away with this sort of behavior, and they are getting away with it, wikipedia becomes a much poorer place, a playground filled with bullies rather than a library where we can all learn and share Also, I don't recal ever having called him/her a bot, I think you put those words in my mouth, perhaps inadvertently His/her behavior is malicious, but probably not malware, just the normal human collection of problems I think this user should be warned against trying to be a gatekeeper, he/she isn't quite qualified for that at this point anyway, and it's having a very chilling effect across wikipedia I won't egnage in a battle of the wikipedia rule acronyms, I will continue to write in English, and to read articles on wikipedia in English, and to think of ways to improve them in English I am fully aware of how the terms vandlism are used and misused here, and most of the rest of the wikijargon Nothing new under the sun here If you read the edits I made carefully, and note the times of the reverts and the history of actions by that other user, you will see I'm not off the mark here at all I know what's going on I don't know why, but I don't have to, and I expect the motivations aren't interesting Respond if you have anything to say   	0

ENGLISH	Summary of situation  User:ShimShem has taken a dislike to this article, and has tried numerous methods to either get it deleted or its name changed 
 1) Completely invalid speedy deletion request
 2) Invalid DRV request
 3) Nominated for deletion via AfD, despite the fact that it had passed an AfD this year - in fact the AfD was withdrawn at 6-0 for Keep
 The current AFD here stands at 9-0 for Keep, but despite that, ShimShem has wikilawyered all the way through it - once it became clear that it was going to be kept, they decided a name change would be better
 4) Changed the name of the band in the article, and was told to take it to talk
 After a brief non-discussion on talk, moved the article anyway, and was reverted

I was originally unsure of the motives of this editor - why they were completely desperate to delete or move this article - until I noted they were interested in Tamil subjects, one of which is MIA (artist), and guessed that they believed that the two could be confused  Their subsequent creation of the article M I A as a redirect to MIA (artist) proved this, as far as I am concerned  

As to whether the band is actually called MIA or MIA, it differs  The band itself uses MIA as the heading on their own website, but then uses a combination of both elsewhere  Since in the case of most sources, this is only likely to be laziness (much as REM are regularly referred to as REM), and since the article has existed here for a while, and that all the backlinks go to this version, and most of all because we shouldn't let disruptive users get their way, the article should stay here	0

 Besides that, you have not shown any sources for your claim that 30000-100000 soldiers were killed

Only because Mr 4meter4 had reverted any of contributions of mine given to this article so far I did not have a single chance to develop it His article called ¨falsetto¨ is not about falsetto It may be about his arrogance, who knows There are a huge contraries regarding only the definition of falsetto There are many signs of entirely different falsetto compare those info which Mr 4meter4 such anxiously protects In England, Italy or Spain 16th century were described entirely different types of falsettos On the top of it, Mr 4meter4 perhaps never heard Pavarotti singing falsetto, or the falsetto of Ian Gillan Singing of King Diamond is based on falsetto What about Michael Kiske? Is it not falsetto? Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston do (did) not sing falsetto? Does any of these falsettos sound breathy? Not to me Isn't out there published a note about those? Maybe only because 4meter4 does not look for it Why? It would not fit to his article He would have to admit that his ONLY source Vennard was probably having in the chair something else than falsetto or he was drunk 4meter4 quickly opened two or three books and things he had swallowed the World The whole physiology of his ¨only¨ falsetto is based on encyclopedia? Well, perhaps it is enough for Wikipedia or himself But not for me No There is much more out there only regarding physiology Much much more And just because you allow idiots like 4meter4 to ¨develop¨ Wikipedia, the people, the readers of Wikipedia will read shit Where are any proves of the research regarding female falsetto at 60ies, Mr Know Everything?

 Removed POV 

I removed undo criticism of Secretary Boutwell and POV Wikipedia is not meant to bash persons reputations whether alive or dead The following has been removed from the article

Boutwell did little to withdraw paper currency from circulation, shaping his financial policy to forestall either inflation or deflation  Intellectual critics saw in these actions a want of guiding principle and a lack of solid theoretical knowledge He believed in knowledge just so far as it was convenient for him to justify his own theory that knowledge was a deception, Henry Adams wrote in a much-quoted analysis in 1870 He believed in common schools, and not in political science; in ledgers and cash-books, but not in Adam Smith or Mill; as one might believe in the multiplication-table, but not in Laplace or Newton By a natural logic he made of his disbelief in the higher branches of political science a basis for his political practice, and thus grounding action on ignorance he carried out his principle to its remotest conclusionsHenry Adams, The Session, North American Review, July, 1870, p 36  But in a very corrupt time, it spoke well of Boutwell that nobody thought that he made money out of his Cabinet post, either for himself or his friends Living within his salary, he lodged in a boarding-house throughout his tenure His only pleasures lay in writing lectures and playing billiards or poker   though never for money Chicago Times, March 6, 1875  He is an inaccessible man, uninfluenced by fear, favor, affection or hope of reward, and does not burst out into brillian exhibitions of love or hatred, a New England politician wrote his brother Henry F French to Benjamin B French, March 16, 1869, Benjamin B French Papers, Library of Congress

Boutwell's financial policy was less dogmatic than pragmaticLiberal reformers had hoped that he would embrace civil service reform and rush the country towards the resumption of specie payments; but while Boutwell appointed subordinates on the basis of merit for the most part, , he did little to rein in the spoils system outside of Washington, remaining on friendly terms with the party bosses''

 Question on Possible Citation 

I'm sorry if I missed your question - I don't pay much attention to that page In response to your question, let me start by repeating my boilerplate formulation: The job of Wikipedia editors is to verifiably summarize reliable sources using the neutral point of view (I haven't yet worked in no original research) WP:NOR says that we mustn't integrate otherwise reliable information to arrive at novel conclusions Comparing two lists and drawing conclusions from their differences and similarities is most likely original research We can integrate information, so long as we don't arrive at new theories Another principle to remember is that vagueness improves accuracy The more precise we are the harder it is to be accurate 

Getting down to details, the Predators and Editors website appears to be a reliable source so we can use it as a source The Bauer site, even if somewhat unreliable, may be used in a limited fashion as a primary source about Bauer I'm not familiar enough with this topic to make pronouncements on what would be correct However I would say that your proposed text appears reasonable The sources are sufficient, and no original conclusions are made The website takedown issue is confusing to me, but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources 

Overall, my opinion is that the less we say about the subject the better Attack articles are not encouraged While we must show our subjects warts and all we shouldn't enlarge the warts, nor ignore their better features Balance is a part of NPOV - 

but you should be able to summarize what you find in reliable sources There no reliable sources only a he said she said blog flame war It is alleged the website takdown was instigated by Bauer It isn't clear if she did, and other factors between the forum and the IP are not known It was the root cause of this article and all the players here were involved via these blogs I don't see how that can be objective 

 Bauer 
I'm sorry I did not get back to you about the Usenet stuff et al, but I've been somewhat overloaded at work Personally, I think the article is better now than when I first saw it, thanks to a lot of effort on the part of the primary editors of the article to bring the best sources and present them in a way that doesn't seem like a lynch mob Y'all are doing a good job, and there should be enough editors on either side to ensure that something resembling nuetral gets posted  I'm glad to help and try and make the article neater, and I don't mean to sound brusque in the summary field, but there was a lot to cram in there Thanks for the note, I appreciate it!   
 I would say Karen saying I've called her names is an out and out fabrication I've never done any such thing 

or whether it's because he's been able to insult me and call me names on Wikipedia, repeatedly and without consequences

I've accused her and Jule of carrying the water for TNH and Absolutewrite and they have That isn't namecalling by a long stretch I'm really weary of these attacks over this This is mob rule While avi seems genuine, she's hanging with a tough insulting tribe The threats against me are real and escalating by the hour Blaming me won't make my points any less valid Nobody likes to be piled on by a crowd It's the Internet equivalent of stoning 

This is not a fabrication I get awfully tired of being called a troll, or part of a mob or cult or group troll, or a self-interested partisan, or a blog comment commando, or other things I could point at if I wanted to depress myself You also made a theoretical comment about me being nosy, fat and ugly Putting the word if in front of it doesn't make it any less of an insult I've tried to be polite to you, and will continue to do so, but this is the response And, please notice, like abi (Avi is Avraham the admin, abi the ML commenter who believes in kindness) I counseled against piling on  | Talk | contribs

 Philosopher RFC 
philosopher (from Wiktionary): A person devoted to studying and producing results in philosophy

I am going to make the case that we must call Stefan Molyneux a philosopher (without qualifiers) in the lead  This is not done as an endorsement or statement about the level of achievement or acceptance of his philosophy, only that it is his career (Note: Not all of the sources I use below are in the article at present The point here is to first convince RFC respondents that philosopher is accurate and widely accepted, then we can make sure the most reliable ones are in place)

 Definitions 
Obviously, each source is going to use slightly different phrasing Some will call him explicitly a philosopher or has views on philosophy, but I think you should consider some other phrases given below as equivalent Using one word philosopher in the lead sentence covers all of his political, ethical, and theistic specializations in one word, which we then elaborate on later in the article

 philosophical conversation, philosophy show - used to describe his Freedomain Radio series
 libertarian, libertarian thinker - Libertarianism is a classification of political philosophies 
 anarcho-capitalist - Anarcho-capitalism  is a political philosophy
 voluntaryist - Voluntaryism (or sometimes voluntarism), is a libertarian philosophy
 athiest - Arguments for atheism range from the philosophical to social and historical approaches
 ethics- Ethics, sometimes known as philosophical ethics, ethical theory, moral theory, and moral philosophy, is a branch of philosophy
 Secular ethics- Secular ethics is a branch of moral philosophy

 Primary source 
As Stefan Molyneux is a living person, we should give great weight to what he says is the focus of his work and his stated profession unless there is reliable evidence to contradict him (obviously, we don't want to host any sort of fringe claims) If we are to dispute what he says about himself, though, then we absolutely must have a strong basis for this, or we open Wikipedia to discredit or liability - this is why BLPs are held to strong standards in the first place I think in this case there is strong and ample evidence that calling himself a philosopher is justified and correct He is a modern philosopher that explores via modern online media, which is obviously a very new phenomenon and so its understandable that its different than the old-school philosophers we're used to

 Freedomain Radio About page - my Master's Thesis analyzing the political implications of the philosophies , I have been fascinated by philosophy - particularly moral theories - since my mid-teens I left my career as a software entrepreneur and executive to pursue philosophy full time through my work here at Freedomain Radio I have written a number of novels as well as many free books on philosophy
 Freedomain Radio (the show that Molyneux hosts) has the tagline The Largest and Most Popular Philosophical Conversation in the World* 
 Molyneux's books show that he is endeavoring to produce tangible written results in the field of philosophy, particularly Universally Preferable Behaviour (UPB): A Rational Proof of Secular Ethics and Against the Gods? A Concise Guide to Atheism and Agnosticism which are two of his more deep dives into the fundamental philosophies
 Strong Atheism: The Case for Evacuating the Middle Ground article
 Why I Am a Philosopher? video - A response to questions about my childhood motivations for pursuing philosophy
 An Introduction to Philosophy - 18-part video course produced by Molyneux describing basic philosophical concepts (Reality, Knowledge, Truth, Gods/Religion, Ethics, and Politics)

Per wiki standards - when to use and external link:

 1) Is it proper in the context of the article (useful, tasteful, informative, factual, etc)? 
 2) Is it a functional link, and likely to continue being a functional link? 
 3) Each link should be considered on its merits, using the following guidelines As the number of external links in an article grows longer, assessment should become stricter When in doubt about the appropriateness of adding new links, make a suggestion on the article's talkpage and discuss with other editors

I generally avoid external links except when it takes me directly to the home page of the aircraft in question - this link does take me directly to NASM's page on this particular P-61 - that makes this external link appropiate  Agree that this page does need more references	0

This is a difficult battle because so far I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior by these admins I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) 

Where one person could be bullied with threats of blocking the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously I will check back here in a couple of days Have courage Regards 20916123886	0

 Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Cheongye Kwan 

Your post at the above AFD on a new martial art bothers me This was the version at the time, that you based your post on You posted:

 I just read the article, and to be quite honest, feel that it does satisfy Wikipedia's guidelines it is reliably sourced Since I believe the notability of the article is satisfied It now has 11 independent sources And to refute the argument posed by Wayne, it is determined by the Phillip Rhee source that the martial arts is not localised

Please consider the concerns this post raises Simple matters like references, notability and noobie basics of AFDs should be routine for any moderately experienced user, and bread-and-butter for any admin In fact a cursory check shows that almost everything you stated was I don't have a word for it Unreal is close

The eleven independent sources that you stated established notability and non-localization at the time, were:
 Three references from 2004 [coates, robinson, shaw], certainly before the topic even existed (!) and all related to a passing piece of news about its founder being on the team of a completely different sport in any event (!)
 Two references from 1st half 2005 [davies, white], almost certainly identical and identically irrelevant to the topic's notability
 The promoter's personal page on his local town website, almost certainly self-published [official village website]
 A 2008 casual interview in a non-notable and possibly non-reliable university magazine (apparently) of the promoter's travels to see experts in a different sport, with tangential tiny (< 1 sentence) mention that he'd discussed his new sport with them too [ the Lau Philip LA interview]
 3 entries marked Reference and support of , Written Reference [chris, cook, rhee], obviously a request by the founder to a friend/colleague write a letter of support, that was never published anyway and isn't cited so you can't have read it (not that it was even possibly valid evidence)
 A short writeup of a local information kind, on the award of the first 4 black belts by the school, in its local paper

In brief of the 11:
 5 were before the sport existed and were not even remotely to do with the topic itself much less sourced material on it or substantial coverage (they had precisely zero coverage); 
 3 were claims of personal I think  is a great guy letters of support, evidently solicited and/or written on request, with zero evidence of verifiable existence, and certainly in no way reliably sourced or independent; 
 1 was self-written
 1 was the briefest of non-mentions in a non-reliable source (pretty much I discussed the topic with them in a college magazine interview)
 1 is local press coverage of his courses that's not even news for a day  or evidence of anything beyond a course by this name is taught twice weekly in our local village hall

Your assessment of these, at AFD, was:
 It is reliably sourced
{| style=border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px width=90%
| 
 There is barely one reliable source in all of those 11 that the sport even exists in the first place (!) - a local newspaper mention that it meets in a village hall on tuesdays and fridays and just awarded its first 4 black belts Probably via self-promotional input 
 There is zero reliable sourcing for any of the rest
|}
 That the cited pages are evidence of notability
{| style=border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px width=90%
| 
 They don't mention it, or even date from a time the topic existed, nor are online versions provided! How on earth could they reliably evidence it?
|}
 That the 11 sources are independent
{| style=border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px width=90%
| 
 3 are claims that please support me letters exist; they are even stated to be personal references; unpublished and uncited
 1 is his own clearly self-written web page on a local village web host
|}
 That the cites show it is non-localized
{| style=border:#c0c0c0 solid 1px width=90%
| 
 The page doesn't list a link so you can't have checked the cite, yet you say the citation proves it 
 The reference openly stated Cambridge University and Bristol Taekwando (!) a big indication of its actual source

 stradbroke galleon / portuguese 

hallo Moondyne, I do admit that when I signed onto Wikipedia I was not aware that it was a concensus community of knowledge Nazis but now that I am aware of it I will make the appropriate adjustments I was under the obviously mistaken impression that Wikipedia was a venue for sharing facts, knowledge and information The notion that the Stradbroke Galleon story is a pet theory of mine is total rubbish as it has been written about, discussed and investigated for more than 100 years by historians and historical groups such as the Royal Historical Society of Queensland, the Maritime Archaeology Association of Queensland and many more too numerous to include here There exists, in various libraries, books and communities a large body of written and oral history concerning the galleon story which I have attempted to fairly and accurately place in the WP domain The fact that a story is not accepted by mainstream academics is not a valid reason for deletion of either of my contributions What has occured here is a classic example of manipulation of an information resource by a vested interest group (ie Hesperian and his friends) who are representatives of the mainstream view Hesperian complain about the media coverage I have recieved but this never appeared in any of the WP contributions I made and Hesperian's mention of the media coverage demonstrates the core reason for Hesperian's antagonistic attitude, simple, old fashioned professional jealousy Thus valid historical data is being deliberately surpressed by Hesperian for personal reasons For example the Portuguese walking stick handle which was found in an Aboriginal midden, identified by a Spanish Musuem offical and story told to me by a UQ Archaeology PhD student is very relevant to the theory of the Portuguese discovery of Australia This kind of knowledge suppression is not what Wiki is about but I guess you do not care as you appear to be part of the happy little click or have been sucked in by Hesperian and his little band of mates, which is a pity, but history is full of the suppression of information by vested interest groups so why should I expect Wiki be any different Still it is dissapointing Happy trails    	0

 Why confusion and controversy in the real world does not preclude the writing of a good Wikipedia on the topic 

Ackoz suggests that, because the real world has not yet hashed out the truth about the expulsions, it is therefore impossible for us to know the truth and thus impossible for us to write about it

I reject such a stance  I think it is difficult but quite possible to write a quality Wikipedia article about a topic that is murky and/or controversial  Where many Wikipedia editors get it wrong is that they believe Wikipedia's job is to report the truth  This is wrong  Wikipedia's job is not to report the truth precisely because it is difficult to determine what the truth is  Any attempt to do that is original research

Instead of truth, Wikipedia aims for verifiability  Put a different way, Wikipedia is committed to recording the state of human knowledge and opinion (not our opinions but those of reliable sources)  If the truth is clear and uncontroversial, it is easy for us to report that  If the truth is murky and controversial, it is more challenging but possible for us to report on what different reliable sources assert and think about a topic EVEN if these reliable sources conflict  Where Wikipedia editors get into trouble is when they start siding with one side of a controversy and asserting that the side that they have selected represents THE TRUTH and not just one perspective (or POV) on the topic at hand

I have been trying to hit this NPOV sweet spot but it is difficult to do so in the midst of a running polemical debate between the two sides

 
Obviously is, because some users (Jadger and Wikiferdi) don't want to discuss in fact, they want us to agree with their POV, that's not discussion about the NPOV edits That's why I quit from the discussion about the form of the article ≈talk≈ 	0

 Regarding Loyalmoonie and LGBT categories 

Looked into it, and this editor seems to be pushing an anti-LGBT agenda They've done similar stuff over at Sailor Moon, and made official-looking warnings to other editors This quote is bizarre, and is quite telling: To insert those categories would ultimately give other people (who may not even support the LGBT movement) reading the article the assumption that every person who does enjoy Sailor Moon is a homosexual (and/or supports SSM) I don't personally watch/read Sailor Moon or know much about it, so I'm not confident enough to re-add the categories, but the reasoning for their removal is flawed regardless, and there is a sourced part in the article about female homosexualitytalk 	0

ENGLISH	::::::Agreed, although it means bloating the alternative title by yet another word I was concentrating on the Polish attitude here, as it clearly provides the starting point for the article at hand Obviously, if the article is to be written from a supra-national perspective, at least the Czech experience needs to be included Czechoslovakia, being the only functioning democracy in the region by the 1930s, had closer ties with the West than Poland did, and was betrayed in a much more obvious and tangible way than Poland was: The West politically accepted the country's territorial mutilation, which was not the case with Poland 

That said, I am not sure if the inclusion of countries such as Finland, the Baltics, Yugoslavia, or even Ukraine (which had never been independent in the first place) is a good idea While the West could have arguably done more to assist any of these societies before and after the war, I think that the article's focus should be on Poland and Czechoslovakia in order not do dilute the whole issue After all, there were dissidents in Germany and the Soviet Union, too, who were harbouring grudges towards Western politicians because of their appeasement policy  19:06, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

The spelling Tacarimba La Tumba Del Fuego Santa Maliga Sacategas Lo Onto Del Sol Y Cruz is the one stated in the lyrics in the vocal score of Side By Side By Sondheim (available for rental only) This version of the song, however, misspells Llanfair PG (presumably to approximate the pronunciation), and has the lyric today's the last I'll be spreading rather than spending It would seem, therefore, that this source cannot be considered canonical This rendering of the place name does accord with Millicent Martin's recording on the Side By Side By Sondheim cast album, however

The published version of the song, as contained in The Hansen Treasury of Stephen Sondheim Songs (Charles Hansen Music & Books, 1977), has the lyric printed as Tacarembo la Tumbe del Fuego Santa Malipas Zacatecas la Junta del Sol y Cruz, and, being a printed source (as opposed to handwritten, as is the vocal score), can presumably be considered definitive Linda Lavin's pronunciation on the original cast recording of The Mad Show (for which the song was written) follows this spelling, which would suggest that the printed version is correct

As it is a fictional place name, however, any discussion of correct spelling/pronunciation is an academic one, at best	0

Speedy deletion of Phi Rho Eta
 A tag has been placed on Phi Rho Eta requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences This part is crucial: say it in your own words

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 12 and later You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or db tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines   	0

I think Clockback that your suggested reference to Ainsworth’s involvement in the IMG is too long and that something along the lines of ‘brief flirtation’ would be better I think that the IMG reference needs to be short/somewhere in the early career section/posted after the article has been expanded a little, otherwise the article might appear weighty I think the last point is important as it seemed to be a consensus reached by a number of Wikipedia editors after much wrangling and gnashing of teeth))

But bedsides, this brief dalliance with Marxism, in an overall consideration of his political career, pales into insignificance compared to his being controversially thrust as a third choice candidate into the position of Defence Secretary at a time of crisis for the British Army in terms of the number of casualties being sustained and a lack of resources This is simply not reflected at all in the Ainsworth article I tried reflecting it as follows: His appointment formed part of a chaotic cabinet reshuffle by the Prime Minister, who considered at least three other candidates before appointing Ainsworth but this was dismissed as speculative opinion by Off2riorob above, even though from my point of view it is easily the most significant event in Ainsworth’s biography Perhaps we can reach a consensus that if a better reference can be found—which I suspect should not be difficult—that it can be re-included? I want to stress that this is again not meant to be an ad hominem slight against Ainsworth, but merely drawing attention to the fact that his appointment was the equivalent of throwing someone in at the deep end (and indeed he has had a very difficult time of it since his appointment) Actually it reflects worse on Brown and the farcical reshuffle  	0

 Greek love 

I'm looking for a way to extricate myself honorably from this mess I'm leaving a note here because you closed this AfD, where I made a commitment to do as you instructed in the closing statement There are two editors who have long sought to delete or eviscerate the article, one of whom has used a series of user names (unacknowledged on his current user page but available , so at first glance it may appear on the talk page there are more than two editors in the 'suppress' camp) I complain here about their coordination Other editors, including  and I simply can't do it any longer I haven't changed my position on the validity of the article, but I've been accused (on various talk pages, and never the appropriate notice boards) of edit warring, ownership, disruption, and even pedophilia by implication, all for trying to carry out what the community decided I'm done I need to limit my time on Wikipedia at present, and wish for that time to be spent pleasantly and productively When I've made a commitment, though, it grieves me not to keep it I'm not asking you to do anything: I'm just explaining why I can't keep my word as given at the AfD   

Wow, that is a messCertainly no hard feelings  on my end, it is clear you endeavored in good faith to improve the article I have found that knowing when to walk away is an essential skill, not only here but in the real world Sometimes your presence, despite your best intentions, is harmful rather than helpful, and sometimes a dispute just isn't worth it anymore Best of luck in your future endeavors here

My experiences came up on the talk page but once I understood Wikipedia I didn't post anything on the article related to my personal experiences That was like the 2nd day almost two months ago

All of my references are verifiableThere's nothing in the article about my law suit or my being put in jail for engaging in pro se litigation  I didn't put my experiences in the Judge Edward Nottingham article either although he was my judge

I went out of my way to search for references expressing all the various sides of the issue For instance, I wrote to the ABA and asked for their input, and in fact, asked them to work on the article I also posted about issues involved with mediation and settlement with pro ses, citing references from a lawyers point of view  Those references were deleted by someone, I can't remember who and don't know why At this point, the only reference that I posted that is soft at all is a blog quoting a transcript quoting a former federal judge and I know for sure that is a valid transcript  The guy who runs the blog is a 3rd year law student and has a business selling data services exclusively to lawyers   Even the stuff that was deleted about pro se frustration I had references for I read in the Wikipedia discussion of sources that blogs can be used in some contexts

I don't believe that I did any original research All I did is search the Internet for references for the article  I really didn't know about unbundled attorney services or the amount of pro se litigation before I started working on this article I had already been thinking about forms based filing but I started thinking about that anyway because of my experiences with ECF, which date back to 2004  Also, when I was younger I worked as a systems analyst

I did get the info on the Laws and Liberties of MA years ago, but Wikipedia already had an article on that and it probably would have come up anyway  Same as the UN covenantcan't really hide that   I didn't add a and b together to prove a point, at least not consciously Like today, I was reviewing appellate procedures and it seemed that the 5th Circuit had a more pro se friendly tone, which I think is because of Judge Learned Hand, who was in the fifth circuit And the only reason I know about that is that one time I went in every federal circuit and searched on the words pro se in the 40s because I was trying to see if there was a history of putting pro ses in jail for being pro se (No, there was not)  What I found in the 40s was that some circuits denied all the pro se appeals without even saying why but Judge Learned Hand seemed pro se friendly

I believe that your posting things about pro se litigants getting an unfair advantage is soap boxing I do understand your wanting to win thru competition though and about law as a business I've been an entrepreneur 

I didn't know about the Federal Judicial Center until I started working on this article That book on appellate procedure I found looking for references for this article The manual on complex litigation I found looking for references for this article

Arguing with you helps me to clarify the issues for myself  One thing I started thinking about a lot in the past few weeks is slavery and how that affected the history of pro se litigation I ordered the book Slave Nation at the library but I haven't got it yet But now when I look at pro se law in the different states I think free state, slave state, border state Also, there were issues related to Indians in some of the western states The labor union movement had a lot to do with it too, I think So did the history of workmen's comp, which is of course related to unions  	0

ENGLISH	Referring to her as *Catherine* 

I was told in no uncertain terms that I could NOT refer to anyone, living or dead, by their 1st names on WP, & if a female had a title, she had to be referred to as that throughout her article - ie, *Lady Amy* or *Lady Dudley* for Amy Robsart, even though *Lady Amy* was wrong before she was married as she was the daughter of a knight & had no title, & wrong after Northumberland was attainted & all his children lost their styles as offspring of an earl & a duke, & she did not become *Lady Dudley* until Elizabeth I knighted Robert Dudley near the end of Amy's life nor was she then *Lady Amy Dudley* as legally she was no longer the wife of the son of an earl & duke  I thought it was simpler to refer to her as just *Amy* throughout rather than explain the changes that occurred with her name & styles, but was told it was against WP *rules* (though I wasn't pointed to a link for it)  Noblewomen are usually called by their 1st names round here as far as I can see, even when they have surnames & are not *of* something!  Mary Boleyn is called *Mary*, not *Lady Carey* or *Lady Stafford*, Catherine Neville is called *Catherine* & not *the Duchess of Norfolk*, etc, & they're not royals  

As for males, I was told they had to be referred to by their title - ie, *Leicester* -  or last name - ie, *Dudley*  I was banging head on keyboard going, but - no one just says *the king* all the time or refers to them as *Plantagenet* or keeps changing their titles - ie, Henry of Bolingbroke going from Earl of Derby to Duke of Hereford to Duke of Lancaster to King of England -  

So how does Kate get to be consistently referred to as *Catherine* throughout the article, without her title appended?  I've only been here a few months & I would appreciate it if someone could actually explain this to me, as my main interest is British history & I am quite confused	0

ENGLISH	DECT isn't really a new technology It's a newer standard, but TDM/TDMA/FDMA digital telephones have been used for a lot longer than the life of DECT DECT is itself a successor to CT2, Japan's PHS is very similar, and, of course, GSM, D-AMPS, and others have been extensively used across the world for a decade and a half To suggest there are special health issues with DECT would most definitely be placing undue weight on the subject DECT is considerably lower power than the analog systems it replaces, both during transmissions, and inherently because even when in use the TD nature of the system means the system isn't transmitting continuously

As I believe I've said before, there is nothing wrong with there being a properly researched article about the health effects of low-power radio technology, and there being a link in the See also: section of this article to it That article, of course, should look nothing like the section I yanked There is nothing about DECT however that merits a special section on DECT's dangers, especially when - new technology or otherwise - there is no serious level of concern being expressed by anyone authoritative on this issue	0

 Rajputs, not Rajasthanisright? -P 

Prof Hancock's studies mention that the Romani people are most closely related to the Punjabis and Rajputs, I'm pretty sure - not Rajasthanis He calls Proto-Romani Rajputic The distinction is important; if they are partly descended from Rajputs, who were never really confined to any one part of India, that would explain the linguistic variation within the Indic words in Romani 

For example, why the use of -o instead of -aa at the end of masculine nouns/adjectives in Romani? This is certainly a characteristic of Gujarati and Sindhi, but is it a characteristic of Rajasthani languages? Anyway, if I'm wrong in making the last change I made as of now, I'll be happy to revert it myself

Words of Encouragement to user Damemk in the cases of dispute with the users engaged in Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda
Damemk, You have come to the same conclusions about Bulgarian 19th Century Nationalistic Propaganda on English Wikipedia
User:Laveol is one of the most prominent editors on Wikipedia contributing false information in the articles about Republic of Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Language|Culture|Sports and what else not
He is spending a lot of time working on his cause, pushing Bulgarian Nature in the articles of the domain of Republic of Macedonia
How far has he gone in pushing this propaganda you can see at Wikipedia:WikiProject_ROMacedonia where he has listed himself as a member
So just my few words of concern for the Macedonian Articles in English Wikipedia, and the great damage done by User:Laveol and other users with the Bulgarian and Anti-Macedonian Propaganda
Hopefully with the internet access becoming more affordable to the people in Republic of Macedonia the things will go in right direction: Removing the Bulgarian Propaganda from Macedonian articles, cleaning them of false fabricated information, and giving the facts to the world, and the views of the Macedonian Science and sources
I don't have much time now, but hopefully will be able to find some more in the coming period I am open to any collaboration|effort for the above goals

I am expecting that this user Laveol will continue with the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and polluting the domains in the domain of Republic of Macedonia, simply because he is able to, and can find a ways to continue to work on his agenda
Ours is to try to remove these false claims and contribute the Facts about the Macedonia, Macedonian Nation|History|Lanugage|Culture|Sports

Damemk, I hope you write something here, at least to show that User_talk:Damemk and User_talk:Ejanev is not the same user    

Some insight into my user name Ejanev
The only user I am using to contribute to Wikipedia is Ejanev It is composed of the first letter of my name Emil and my last name Janev
User Damemk is a separate user Probably that user name is comming from Dame - a Macedonian First name, and mk or the code of Republic of Macedonia
It does happen that I am from Canada I was born in Republic of Macedonia and have lived there until I moved to USA first and Canada before more than 3 years

And yes, having all the false information from the Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda ( originating from the 19th century ) and having it into 21st century to be used to negate the Macedonian Nation and all it's attributes by users as Laveol, is the reason of some of my editing actions in Wikipedia
I am not the only user/editor from Republic of Macedonia or with Macedonian origin that has the same views for this Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda, that already is infiltrated in the Macedonian articles
You can watch the contributions of Special:Contributions/Laveol and see that more than 50% of his actions are engagement in negating the Macedonian Nation and its attributes

 POV concerns 

Im surprised this article isn't being called anti-semetic, because it's has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced

This entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you'd think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim) Here is a great example Look at this citation

According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa'd ibn Mua'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: Sa`d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba's gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender

This author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it's a fact?

There are articles for Criticisms of Islam where the Jews and others can write whatever they want But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate criticisms of Islam articles If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles

Good day

Changes by Devotus and issues with them

Dear Devotus, 
I have still issues with your changes:
Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don't try you shift the balance - removing a book from each side - I do not agree with your removal Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn't serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference This is due to the insistence of User:Bless sins He will certainly not like such a removal We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article
While your first version was needlessly verbose (it is to be noted that), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences
Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the siege and demise, eg the claim about attacking M in the rear
Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict We fought hard and long about words like massacre and execution and neither should appear unless unavoidable

 Mediation 

Hello, I am Atyndall and I have volunteered to take on your mediation case, during this discussion I will remain neutral with both sides of this argument and will endeavor to solve your dispute After having a look at the discussion above, this is what I have found:
QuizzicalBee has been adding the sentence According to Chesler, the the US embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country as they no longer recognized her as a US citizen, Hurmata has been reverting this back to She reports that the US embassy repeatedly refused to help her leave the country Hurmata objects to QuizzicalBee's sentence as he/she thinks that the source is incorrect as the guards would have allowed Chesler into the embassy and first hand accounts from Chesler herself does not qualify as a reliable source QB objects, saying that maybe in the 1960s US citizenship could have been revoked by the US/Afgan government at that time and perhaps in the past the guards may have denied entry and that her claim should have been presumed true until proven false Hurmata countered that the citation threat QB was referring to is not the one that was cited QB states that there is no evidence disproving her claims, so they are valid

ENGLISH	Well, Arthur, I have printed the paper, and the condition is in fact what UltraPower says it is, not your correction It seems that the paper is not incorrect, but rather correct and pointless

You have already identified the worst problem: The third condition requires incontinuity of f at all integer values However, this problem disappears if we consider only the special case a=e So let's do that

We want a function f satisfying f(1)=e and f(n+1)=exp(f(n)), defined as widely as possible We observe that n=0 and n=1 present no problems: f(0)=1 and f(-1)=0

To extend f to all positive real numbers, it is clearly sufficient to define f on an interval of length 1, such as [0,1)

And we want f to be continuously differentiable (The paper only requires f to be continuously differentiable on (0,1), or equivalently on (-1,0) This is obviously whacky, but we needn't worry about this because a=e)

Next, for no obvious (or explained) reason we require that f ' is monotone on the interval [0,1] From the functional equation f(x) = ln f(x+1) we get f '(x) = f '(x+1)/f(x+1) Hence f '(-1)=f '(0)/f(0)=f '(0), so f ' must be constant on [0,1]! 

Not too surprisingly, the function we get in this way is patched together from smaller pieces in a relatively unnatural way: f(x) = exp[x](exp(x-[x]))

Thus what I learned from the paper is that the correct solution to the problem probably has a minimum of its derivative between -1 and 0	0

What i am trying to say is that although Bashar assad had good economic and international policies for Syria, you should not fear a non-baathist potentially being elected  Syria's economic and international policies won't change (iran would still be a major factor in Syrian life considering the buisness deals stakes and cultural exchanges) , the only this that would change are social freedoms, and for the better Also every country had a revolution and they are still alive today The Muslim brotherhood in Syria is weak, even weaker than the islamist prescence in Libya The rebels in Libya had 80-90% support, as we see now, and yet could hardly take control without NATO What chance does the Syrian Muslim brotherhood have? None If anything, nonviolent protests weaken the resolve of the Muslim brotherhood, making them less of an influence in the everyday life of Syrians As you know I am pro Syria and Armenia, just not pro Assad Unlike Armenia where people like Sargsyan and Kopcharyan were democratically elected, Assad was not (no one ran against him because they were not allowed)	0

ENGLISH	{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1 Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you admins tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as personal attacks or harassment when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2 For exampleand this is yep, maybe you guessed it question 2: Why is it supposedly okay (according to you) for someone with a name like, say escape orbit to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly okay for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of ebaY logo to go next to the current one, ebay, in the lead, is because I wanted it in there, even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly not okay for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3 Here's another one: Why is it supposedly okay for him and smiley girl there to falsely accuse my edits of being vandalism just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a personal attack just because I'm an IP-only editor?

Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack', or Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' ?

5 Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that  'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called consensus too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called consensus wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) consensus wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive consensus, do the same thing, it's edit-warring even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense rule)?

 Trying to measure the number of cafes 

This is one of those places where I am so frustrated by Wikipedia's ban on original research The article has the absurdly low at least six cafes on the Ave or its alleys I don't know where that number comes from, nor what they consider a cafe, but it seems to me that well within any reasonable definition, the scene includes:
 Solstice
 Cafe Zoe
 The original Allegro (on an alley parallel to the Ave); arguably, its second location in the College Inn also counts
 The Ugly Mug (half block off)
 The Cafe at the corner of 42nd that used to be the Roma, but I can't recall its new name
 Sureshot
 The Continental
 Caffe Apassionato
 WOW Bubble Tea
 Shinka Tea Company
 Yunnie Bubble Tea
 Pochi Tea
 Gingko Tea House
 Tully's 
 Starbucks
 Wannabee (one block off)
 Still Life on the Ave (at the Grand Illusion); technically, the entrance is around the corner, but it is clearly effectively on the Ave

This doesn't even count hangouts that are mainly bars or restaurants or takeout food joints, nor does it count things like U Bookstore and Bulldog News, both of which have busy espresso operations, nor does it count ice cream stands And I'm sure I'm missing something, this is all just offhand -  | Talk 	0
ENGLISH	Actually, undue weight can also results in zero weight  As it is the whole issue is insinuation and extrapolation of given events  Just because the article doesn't outright say that Edwards is the father because there was no father listed, it is quite clear that this is the intent  Now, editors familiar with me consider me to be a FNC fanboy and appolgist regarding conservatives and republicans, so my objection to this is clearly not a partisan point of view  That said this is in violation of several WP policies	0

ENGLISH	Bakan 

Why is Abbie Bakan even mentioned in this article?  Based on the worthless rag of hers which is cited as a source in this article, she's nothing but a shill for Lenin and the rest of the commie gang  In that rag, she not only shows egregious pro-Communist bias, but doesn't even bother to check the facts, much less look at the causes of the Kronstadt rebellion or even cite reliable historical sources on that subject  She also discredits herself with absurd accusations of a White conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet government and even of the rebellion being motivated by anti-semitic racism among the sailors  Furthermore, all the claims made in that rag are based on a case of begging the question: that is, since Lenin's Communist regime was good (major premise) and the Kronstadt rebellion harmed said regime (minor premise), suppressing the rebellion was justified  Last but not least, the mere fact that the aforementioned rag was first published by a self-admitted socialist party by definition means that this source DOES NOT meet EITHER WP:NPOV OR WP:RS  If such sources continue to be used in Wikipedia articles, the whole project will soon turn into Commiepedia 67169177176	0

Your suggestion of editing the article is completely workable and was working as per Wikipedia guidelines until Jayjg and SlimVirgin started deleting large relevant chunks of the article, and reverting it to what we have now, as punitive gestures  If we can all agree to concentrate on making the article better, instead of punishing each other, there is no reason the article has to be locked
I agree that we should start with an extremely innocuous definition preamble statement we can all agree on  However, a definition doesn't do anyone any good unless it conveys some sort of information  If there were just one word that we could all agree is associated with terrorism, that would be better than no definition at all: intimidate for instance   	0

 Bloc voting 

Countries with large populations of non-nationals may have their televote influenced considerably This has been cited as the reason for apparent bloc voting in the Balkan countries of the former Yugoslavia[91] 

This is full-blown crazy What does non-nationals mean? These countries have similar cultures and speak the same languages The stars in Croatia are popular in Serbia and vice versa People are nationals of their countries in the largest proportion in each of those countries (there are some refugees in each of those countries, but that doesn't really explain why Croatia would always give the highest no of pts to Serbia, or Macedonia to Serbia, where there was no conflict to speak of) For example, I'm a Bosnian Serb and me voting for a Croatian or a Serbian song is not unusual But I'm not a Bosnian non-national I have the passport of BiH, and my family has never lived in Serbia in history It's really about mutual intelligibility  which is why Scandinavian bloc votes for each other all the time It's the language and sensibility	0

All you have on verifiable record is that the 103 original signers called for skeptical examination of the evidence for scientific theories  DI's unverifiable claim which fraudulently spins that into consensual agreement or support for their interpretation or political agenda is not a fact under the rules of Wikipedia  

All the rest of DI's propaganda is utter hogwash fraudulently perpetrated by the DI without the verifiably demonstrated consent of the original 103 individuals
